# bouncy-balls
Easily decorate an HTML canvas with a bouncy ball mini-game.

Just include the script into a page and decorate a `canvas` with the `bouncy-ball` id...

```html
<canvas id="bouncy-ball"></canvas>
<script src="BouncyBallGame.js"></script>
```

... then click on the canvas to get going.  See the code for a more complete example which is [on display here](http://www.joelsleppy.com/portfolio/bouncy-ball-game/ "Bouncy-Balls example").

#### Wishlist
1. ~~Make the game resistant to canvas resizing.~~
2. ~~Respect ball radius in boundary collisions.~~
3. Scale the ball speed to better match canvas size?
4. Ball-on-ball collisions?!?!
