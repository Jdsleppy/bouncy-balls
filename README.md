# bouncy-balls
Easily decorate an HTML canvas with a bouncy ball mini-game.

Just include the script into a page and decorate a `canvas` with the `bouncy-ball` id...

```html
<canvas id="bouncy-ball" height="300" width="300" style="background-color: #DDDDFF"></canvas>
<script src="BouncyBallGame.js"></script>
```

... then click on the canvas to get going.

#### Wishlist
1. Make the game resistant to canvas resizing.
2. Respect ball radius in boundary collisions.
3. Scale the ball speed to better match canvas size.
4. Ball-on-ball collisions?!?!
